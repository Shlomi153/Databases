If TempDB files are corrupted, follow the following steps:

1) Run sqlserv exe in the bin file of the SQLServer folder.

2) Open CMD as admin, run:
cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn

sqlservr -c -f -T3608 -T4022 -s MSSQLSERVER -mSQLCMD

Details:
-c parameter quickens the SQL Server startup time
-f parameter loads SQL Server in minimalistic mode
Trace flag 3608 prevents SQL from loading anything save the Master Database, TempDB is created only if something really requires it
Trace flag 4022 disabled any automatic Stored Procedures
-s parameter is something we use to specify the instance we want to connect to
-mSQLCMD so that we can connect to the instance with SQLCMD

All of this so that we can reset TempDB via SQLCMD.
Note: for duration of the whole operation, CMD should stay open.

3) Open SQLCMD and run:
exec master..sp_resetstatus tempdb
GO

4) When this step completes, close SQLCMD and exit the original CMD windows using Ctrl + C

5) Open SQL Server Configuration Manager, restart the instance.
New Tempdb files will be created in the default location and the instance should start successfully.
